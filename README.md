Description: This project demonstrates client-side form validation using JavaScript. It validates user input in a form before submitting it. Additionally, upon successful validation, it displays a success message and allows users to preview the submitted data in a read-only format.

Learning Concepts:

Form validation: Understand how to use JavaScript to validate user input in forms before submission. This helps ensure data integrity and prevents invalid data from being processed.
DOM manipulation: Learn how to access and modify form elements (like displaying error messages or disabling input fields) based on validation results.
Event handling: Capture the form submission event and trigger validation logic using JavaScript.
